        <h3>Here is information about our site.</h3>
        <p>The mission of the Movie Ticket Sales Site is to help out local movie theater businesses around the U.S. to provide the latest technology that major entertainment companies (AMC, Regal, etc.) use to create easier ways to watching movies! We invite several local businesses to provide their locations and list of movies, as well as providing employee information to provide management services for our website. We allow our customers to create their own accounts for FREE and browse a ton of movies that local movie theater businesses provide, as well as providing feedback on how well each movie theater provider handles their customers. We, at the Movie Ticket Sales Site, want to help out local movie theater businesses by creating easier ways to enhance the experience of going out to the movies.</p>
